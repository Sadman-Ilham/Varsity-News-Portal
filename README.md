*Present Situation*

I have started this project to implement all the java web technologies that I'm learning through. Till no I've used,
  - Servlet
  - JSP
  - Maven
  - MVC
  - Singleton design pattern
Right now I'm working on the back end. To monitor all my back end works I've used a downloaded template(html,css,js). But sooner I will be working on the front end from the begining to make it more organized.

*Features that I've implemented till now*

  - Register as an user
  - Log in as an user
  - Make a home view for general user (without registered account)
  To be continued...

*Toold I've used so far*

  - Language: Java
  - Technologies: Servlet, JSP, Maven.
  - RDBMS: MySql
  - IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

*I've also used this project as an academic project for the course 'java networking programming'*
